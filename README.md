Trade.py generates a trade.
1. Clone this repo
2. Go to https://alpaca.markets/ create an account
3. Create a paper trading account(technically you could make a real account too, but I recommend you start with paper.) 
4. Alpaca will generate an API key and Secret Key, save those.
5. Create a config.py file locally, use this file to securely store your API and Secret keys. 
  In config.py:
  - "APCA-API-KEY-ID": "PASTE YOUR ALPACA API KEY HERE",
  - "APCA-API-SECRET-KEY": "PASTE YOUR ALPACA SECRET KEY HERE",
